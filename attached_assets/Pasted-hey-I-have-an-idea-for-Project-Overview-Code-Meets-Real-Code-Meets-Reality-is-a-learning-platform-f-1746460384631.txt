hey I have an idea for Project Overview: Code Meets Real Code Meets Reality is a learning platform for beginners to understand how coding concepts like if-else or inheritance are used in real-world applications. It shows simple code on one side, a real-life example above it, and a live visual output below. Users can run the code with a built-in compiler and get help from an AI tutor whenever they’re stuck. It makes learning coding clear, practical, and beginner-friendly.
Helping beginners connect code to the real world
The Problem Space –  “Stuck in Syntax”
Lack of Real-World Context
Beginners often fail to understand where and how a coding concept is used in real life.

Abstract Concepts Are Hard to Visualize
Concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, or if-else feel too theoretical without visual or practical mapping. 

Beginner Frustration and Doubt
New learners often question, “Am I doing it right?” or “Is this even useful?” because they can’t see the code’s actual impact.

Too Much Theory, Not Enough Interaction
Text based tutorials and videos don't let students interact with code or see instant visual feedback.

Information Overload
Beginners are often thrown into advanced examples or competitive problems too early, which leads to burnout.
Real-World Code Mapping 
Show how basic concepts (like if-else or inheritance) are used in real-world applications, making abstract topics easier to relate to.
Visual GUI Representation
Show how the code behaves through a simple, visual GUI.

Interactive 3-Panel Layout
Combine code, real-world example, and GUI output in one split-screen view.

Built-in Code Runner
Let users write and test code instantly inside the platform.

AI Learning Assistant
Provide 24/7 personalized help through an AI tutor built into the platform.
The project can expand easily by supporting more programming languages beyond Java.AI integration allows for personalized learning experiences through tools like OpenAI. Gamification and community-driven content can boost user engagement and platform depth. It also holds strong potential for educational partnerships with schools and coding bootcamps
MVP of this project should have these features mentioned below :-
A simple learning web app that helps beginners understand code by showing
A basic code example (like if-else) A real-world example where it’s used (like login system)
A visual screen of how it looks (GUI view)
What will it include?
Code editor to run beginner code
Real-world example of that concept
Visual output showing how the code looks in a real app
Easy-to-use interface for learners 
Why it’s useful?
Makes learning coding easier and fun
Helps connect theory to real life
Great tool for beginners to learn faster
so as I provided you all the things what's in my mind okay so please provide me as i pasted image here front end Ui is like this and add in the provided frontend Ui image add sidebar also over there where in side bar it consists of if-else button ,OOps Button, Decorators button ,  user Functions Button and side bar will be slideable on  all these buttons that is in side bar should inside the references icon when we click over this icon sidebar automatically opens and all four buttons that i told you before all buttons should be functionable whene user click on that an pop up canva type window will appear on the screen as in chat gpt it appears and an prompt related to that button name will pass to the Any Ai server if possible use chatgpt's API so that irelated to that educational content will appear on the canva window s i told earlier with some real worl use case scenarios with dry Run logics so that user can understand more precisely then there should we an icon to minimize that window and refence icon which i told should be on left side having some hover effect which is centrally alligned left side of the front view of our page and also there will appear an text when we hover over those icons i told name and add history icon and on setting icon also just below reference icon and all these icons should be centrally alligned in the left side with some padding and also while hovering over them they shold show their name as text as i told and all should functioning and what ever in the image i send you all should function as there is an begginer code option it should function accordingly while cliccking over run button it must show output as in code editors have which will automatically slides up from the bottom when we run the code it will show out put and there is an cross icon over console run window so that we can again fix it from where it came . and other two parts also must work as their name as Real world code :- in this section real world use case of the code user tyoed in begginer code like if he wrote about ,if -else ,  ,OOps related code , Decorators, user Functions that will auto matically managed by our backend and in practice area user can practice related to that code which will suggested by. Ai as our backend will use Ai API and in interactive Demo section which is changeable related to that real world- code which is in Real - world code section and according to this an interactive UI that will work Accordingly in the in this demo section and there will also an helpline support in right bottom most side which also working accordingly so provide me each and every single line code in seperated files as for frontend use HTML , CSS, Javascript , and make their individual files with their file extentions and connect them each other and make sure that all the things are covered whatever i told for frontend as i instructed , and write backend codes also using python and Fast Api frame work and build connections with them make it modular backend so that we can scale it easily with their required extensions files and after finishing all the  codes add backend and frontend to each other and use a database if needed for this storing tasks and add a debugger tool also which will monitor everything and save it in individual file as debugger with suitable extension file provide me all net and clear codes by following SOLID principles of programming and also guide me how to use those codes so that i can run efficiently and let me know the libraries of python or anything which is needed to download so that not to stuck anywhere.
